# Moby Dick Project


This is using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API to read in a file when it is dropped into an HTML element, in 
this case, text for Herman Melville's book Moby Dick. The list of the top 100 most frequently occurring 
words (excluding stop words) paired with the count of occurrences of the word, found in the text, is parsed
out of the text and displayed in a bar chart after it is dropped in.
